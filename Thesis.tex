\chapter*{Abstract}
%The first-half of the 20th century saw an explosion of collage practices spanning all mediums.  In the early 20th-century in Paris, Picasso and Braque were experimenting with gluing visual fragments of culture represented by stamps, newspaper clippings, and photos onto the canvas of their paintings.  At a Dadaist rally in the 1920's, Tristan Tzara created a poem by taking cut-up fragments of existing texts such as newspapers or brochures out of a hat and verbalizing them\footnote{leading to a riot destroying the theatre on location and the expulsion of Tzara from the movement by Andre Breton.}.  At about the same time in 1925, the Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein demonstrated the power of film montage in \textit{Battleship Potemkin} as he juxtaposed image sequences such as a crowds flight down a staircase for 7 minutes with the image sequence of a baby carriage, creating viscerally new experiences and emotions than either sequence alone could have.  And by the end of 1940's, Pierre Schaffer and Pierre Henry were experimenting with splicing and recombining magnetic tape recordings of sound in a practice they called musique concrete.  

%Since then, collage practices have only evolved, becoming more ubiquitous and easier to do.  Further, as media has moved into the digital domain, the possibilities for collage have also become far more expansive, allowing for large corpuses of media that would have taken years or even lifetimes to edit if done through their analog counterparts. 

%Collage is a process that assembles together fragments of culture represented by sound or visual media.  Traditionally, this practice used physical media, or analog content, such as tape recordings spliced and reassembled, photos cut-and-pasted, or pieces of paper glued to a canvas.  More recently, this practice has evolved to use digital media, where files on hard disks representing sound files or photos are manipulated with software known as non-linear editors for dynamic content such as audio or video or something along the lines of Adobe Photoshop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} for images.  The majority of digital collage practitioners work with an existing archive of audio or visual media manually selecting what they believe to be interesting or relevant parts of an existing photo, video or sound file in order to create a new composition with that material.  However, as tools for production become smarter, the methods for composition will also become more automated.  This thesis investigates the development of an automated audiovisual collage process, where large amounts of digital audio and visual media such as from YouTube or Flickr may be collaged to produce entirely new content.

%However, as copyright law has also evolved over the last 100 years, this practice has seen a significant increase of law suits.  One reason is that the interpretation of copyright in the digital domain is much different than in the analog one.  Copies in the analog domain are protected by their production.  However, in the digital domain, a copy is produced whenever information is accessed from a hard disk, making the pure access of information a possible infringement.  This and many other peculiarities of copyright law and their influence on collage practice will be discussed in greater detail later.  

%Our experience of the world is a rich narrative fragmented in terms of objects, people, and places.  Yet, the multitude of physical signals which are used to create this experience, such as various light and sound sources and their reflections from what we understand as objects, are representational-less and concept-less in nature.  The fundamental question of how we perceive and represent our experiences is an important question in numerous fields.

%Digital media collections such as image, sound, or video libraries are growing at enormous rates.  Finding information within these collections often entails searching for tags such as its filename, the date it was taken, or some loose category that may describe it.  Alternatively, pattern recognition has started to offer methods for automatically clustering and describing patterns within the contents of large amounts of digital media.  Many methods, including ones presented in this thesis, are even designed in similar ways to how humans are thought to perceive.  This allows one to not only find something of interest based on similarities in their content, but also affords entirely new and interesting interactions with that media's content.  Broadly, this approach to understanding media is known as content-based information retrieval.  

%However, it forms only one piece of many to this thesis.  The other notable chunk lies in the motivation for how the patterns within the media are detected.  This is based on theory and techniques coming from multiple fields including information theory, auditory scene analysis, computer vision, computational photography, compression, psychology, and neuroscience, offering multiple perspectives for understanding concepts that will be explored later such as entropy, invariance, representations, encoding, and temporal incoherences.  

%The other significant chunk lies in the outputs produced by my arts practice, connecting human-computer interaction and sound and visual culture.  This practice often explores digital approaches to collage and media appropriation as well as issues of digital media ownership presented by copyright and digital rights management.  This will be discussed in greater detail when discussing the numerous copyright violations I've received after running a project essential to this thesis, YouTube SmashUp, for 5 weeks.  My practice also often involves experiencing aspects of the pattern recognition machinery in real-time, creating novel forms of information retrieval browsers which are created as simulations of hallucination, or a 3D file-browser visualization that double as an instrument and a tool for understanding large audio corpora.
